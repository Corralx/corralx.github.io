title: Helios
name: helios
description: <p>Helios is an implicit surface renderer using the common Sphere Tracing algorithm, written in C++11 and OpenGL 4.3, using the modern Compute Shaders feature. It allows live reloading of the scene and automatically exposes the user-declared variables in the shader as GUI widget, to easily experiment with implicit surfaces!</p><p>Works on Windows and Linux. Requires a decent GPU with fairly recent drivers and OpenGL 4.3+ support.</p>
