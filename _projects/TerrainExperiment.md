title: Terrain Experiment
name: TerrainExperiment
description: <p>This really simple WebGL experiment is built to investigate the generation of a "chunkified" terrain from a greyscale image, and experiment with frustum culling and the possible related optimizations. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> key can be used to switch between the culled camera and the global one to see the culling in action.</p><p>Should work on every browser, both desktop and mobile, with WebGL 1.0 support.</p>
