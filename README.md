This is the repository for my personal website.

## Thanks
The project is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the following libraries:
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [SlickNav](http://slicknav.com/)
* [Lightbox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/)

The theme is a Jekyll port of the [Midnight Theme](https://github.com/mattgraham/midnight) by [Matt Graham](http://madebygraham.com/), based on the modification made by [rcrmn](http://rcrmn.github.io).
