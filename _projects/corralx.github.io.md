name: corralx.github.io
description: <p>This is my personal space built with Jekyll, to organize my projects, write down stuff and ideas on the blog (and possibly start some interesting discussions in the comments), and in the end just make me feel like I need to give myself and my work a better presentation overall.</p><p>It is built to be responsive and compatible with every browser, both desktop and mobile.</p>
