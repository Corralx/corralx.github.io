Hi, I'm Matteo Bertello, also known as Corralx on the web, and this is my new personal website.
This place was built to have a place where I can write my thoughts, give my personal projects a cleanup and let them live on my personal [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}), and possibly starts some interesting conversations and collaborations.

<i class="excerpt" aria-hidden="true"></i>

I am a C++ developer interested in:

- Rendering APIs
- Multithreading
- Sphere Tracing
- Compute Shaders
- Ray Tracing
- Virtual Reality
- Temporal Logic

platform, linux, open source, opengl ma d3d e vulkan, dove lavoro? Linkare about?

If you are not visualising this website correctly or have any question related to my projects, feel free to contact me using the social buttons on the top menu.

Thanks!
